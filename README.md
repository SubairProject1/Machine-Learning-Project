# Project Overview

+ The task required developing and comparing multiple machine learning approaches and improving them through:

+ Data cleaning and preprocessing

+ Train/validation splits

+ Cross-validation

+ Hyperparameter tuning (e.g., grid search)

+ Evaluation using metrics such as accuracy & confusion matrices

Final predictions were submitted directly on Kaggle, which displayed performance on public and private leaderboards.

## Models Implemented

At least two models were required. Examples include:

+ Decision Tree Classifier

+ Random Forest Classifier

Additional models were tested to compare performance and robustness.

## Evaluation

Each model was evaluated via:

+ Cross-validation accuracy

+ Confusion matrices

+ Leaderboard performance (public & private)

+ Comparison to baseline models such as random, majority voting, and provided reference models

A short concluding summary explains model choice, hyperparameter decisions, and preprocessing rationale.
